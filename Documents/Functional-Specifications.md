# Overview

The goal of this project is to create a video game with innovant ideas within 6 weeks.
The idea is to teach students principles of game design, during this project we will learn every fundamentals of creating a video game, from the creation of concepts to create the balance between every element.

To create a video game we will use multiple tools such as:

- Unreal Engine 4
- Modeling app such as blender
  
As for the audience we are aiming, we are aiming for every type of users, from 8 years old to 80 years old. However if you want more specific informations about potential users, you have a document in this document: [Personas](./Personas.md)

# Game overview

## Story

The story takes place in a fantasy world, humans are the most dominant species, goblins, orcs, phantoms, andcountless creatures can be found, but beware, they are lurking in the dark, waiting for the long-desired moment where they can crush all civilization and hope. You are the king, head of your country and its armies, you will have to defend your glorious kingdom against endless waves of monsters and sometimes traitors, but you are not alone, powerful artifacts will lead your way during this journey, defend your kingdom and your people my king, may the gods be with you.

## Mechanics

Our team is searching for innovative ideas, to attain them we wanted to aim to a new type of gameplay, our game is a tower defence game mixed with a roguelite[^roguelite] style, the user is defending his castle with the same mechanics as a standard tower defence but using a system of card and deck.

To explain a bit further, the user have a hand of card, generated randomly after each waves in a level depending of user's deck. To use it's card, the user will have to use he's mana, a ressource refilled as the same time as the hand.

The user will be able to place his towers on the map which is cut into a grid, they can also upgrade his towers and even give a bonus to them. By placing towers the user will be able to create a maze to make ennemies' advance longer and more difficult.

Furthermore, the levels will be chosen by the user by using a procedural[^procedural] generation for the list of levels.

## Gameplay

The gameplay was made to be simple to grasp within short time, the battle phase is cut in two different part, the setup and the play phase.

##### Setup phase

The setup phase is, as its name suggest a moment where the player is able to setup his towers. At the start of the phase the player will see his mana refilled and will have 5 more cards in his hand. At this moment the player will have to think about how to use his mana to place towers on the grid, (example, the player has an archer tower and a crossbow tower, they cost 2 and 3 but the player only has 4 mana, they has to choose which tower they can place or use none of them). Something to note is that during this phase, the view automatically transform to an aerial view.

When the player has finished his preparations they can push the button "new wave" and the battle phase starts, making the camera come back to an isometric view.

At the end of the phase the player keep his cards, however, they can hold until 20 cards maximum, if the player has his hand full, new cards directly go to the discard pile, to avoid the player to be stuck, they can send directly card in his hand to the discard pile for free.

Finally if the player's deck is empty, his discard pile is shuffled and put back in the pile.

##### Play phase

The play phase represent the phase where ennemies are coming, the towers attack nearby ennemies and the phase ends when all ennemies are killed, except for boss battles, if the boss is not killed after a certain amount of time, it calls reinforcment and every ennemies are twice as fast, it is to avoid a battle phase that last longer than expected. Finaly, during this phase, the player can use his remaining mana to cast spell cards, they can temporaly enhance towers or even slow or hurt ennemies.

## Design

## Mockups

The image below is showing the interface during the play phase, on the bottom you can observe player's hand of card, on the right it's pile and on the left the discard pile, as the norm dictates.

On the middle you can see the grid, this is wahere players can use their card and create their maze, naturally this is where ennemies will appear and this is where they will be marching toward the castle.

Now, for the interface part, on the castle's left you can see the player's mana, on the top, you can see as it follows : the artifact inventory, the number of wave, the pause button and finaly under the pause button there is a "new wave" button (not visible on the mockup), this button serve to end the setup phase, hovering it reveal which monsters will come and how many of them there is.

Finally on the left of the card you may have noticed there is a grey square, it is where we will put an almanach, it is a book to describe towers' and ennemies' features and, if we have the time, their lore[^lore].
