## Mechanics

Our team is searching for innovative ideas, to attain them we wanted to aim to a new type of gameplay, our game is a tower defence game mixed with a roguelike style, the user is defending his castle with the same mechanics as a standard tower defence but using a system of card and deck.

To explain a bit further, the user have a hand of card, generated randomly after each waves in a level depending of user's deck. To use it's card, the user will have to use he's mana, a ressource refilled as the same time as the hand.

The user will be able to place his towers on the map which is cut into a grid, he can also upgrade his towers and even give a bonus to them. By placing towers the user will be able to create a maze to make ennemies' advance longer and more difficult.
