# 1. Presentation

## 1.1. Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a video game with innovant ideas within 6 weeks. The idea is to teach students the principles of game design, during this project we will learn every fundamentals of creating a video game, from the creation of concepts to the balance between every element. Another important point is to learn how to work in a team, and to learn how to use the tools we will use to create our game, but also to respect deadlines given each weeks.

<br/>

# 2. Technologies Used

## 2.1. Unreal Engine [WIP bullet points + and repetition]

Unreal Engine is a game engine developed by Epic Games, famous games have been created using this engine, such as Fortnite, Gears of War, Rocket League and many others. This engine has some major advantages :

- 
 that makes it a good choice for our project, to begin with, it is free to use and has a lot of free assets, and it is almost always very easy to use, it also has a lot of tutorials and documentation to help us learn how to use it. Unreal Engine is also very powerful, and is able to create very good graphics. It also has a pretty unique feature, named Blueprints, which allows the user to create their own scripts without having to learn a programming language, it will be very useful to simplify the development process. The version we will be using for this project is Unreal Engine 4.27.

# 3. Game Presentation

## 3.1. Game Description


The Card Kingdom is a Tower Defense game, the player will have to defend their base from waves of enemies. The player will have to place towers on the map to defend their base, and they will have the possibility of upgrading them to defeat enemies more easily. One of the main features of the game is the possibility to create your own deck of cards, and to use them in the game. The player will have to create a deck of 20 cards, and they will have 7 cards in his hand. The player will have the choice between 2 different types of cards which are towers and spells. In order to use each cards, the player will have to use mana, and each turn the player will have its mana refilled. The player will have to use their cards wisely in order to defeat the enemies.

<br/>

## 3.2. Game Mechanics


### 3.2.1. Towers

Towers are the first type of cards. The player will have to place them on the map, and they will automatically attack enemies. There are 5 different towers, each one with their own characteristics. The player will have to be careful when placing them, because they have a range, and if they are too far from the enemies, they won't be able to attack them, but also because the player won't be able to destroy them after they have been placed. The towers will have different mana cost, based on their DPS, and on their cost efficiency, which is the ratio between the cost of the tower and its DPS. The towers range are based on a circle, and the towers will attack the closest enemy in their circle. The player will only be able to place towers during the setup phase, before the next wave of enemies. Once a tower is placed it will stay on the map until the end of the game, and the card will disappear from the player's hand.

<br/>

### 3.2.2. Temples

Temples are the second type of cards. There are 4 different temples, each with their own characteristics and buffs. The player will have to place them on the map, and they will give buffs to the towers around them. The player will have to be careful when placing them, because they have a range, and if they are too far from the towers, they won't be able to give them buffs. The temples will have different mana cost, based on their buffs. The temples range are also circle-based, and the temples will give buffs to the towers in their circle. The player will only be able to place temples during the setup phase, before the next wave of enemies. Once a temple is placed it will stay on the map until the end of the game, and the card will disappear from the player's hand.

<br/>

### 3.2.3. Spells

Spells are the third type of card. They are used to deal damage to enemies, or slow them down. There are 4 different spells. The player will be able to use them at any time during the wave of enemies, and they will cost mana. Once a spell is used it will disappear from the player's hand.

<br/>

### 3.2.4. Mana

Mana is the resource used to play cards, the player will get 6 mana at the beginning of each turn. Every unspent mana will be added to the player's mana pool at the end of the turn, the maximum mana amount that the player can have is 10. 

<br/>

### 3.2.5. Deck

The player will have to create a deck of 20 cards, and will have 6 cards in his hand. The player will be able to add multiple times the same card in the deck for instance, 3 archer tower, 2 snowballs, etc. so there will be a chance to draw the same card multiple times. There won't be any limit to the number of same cards that the player can add to the deck, which means that the player could have 20 times the same card, that wouldn't be an efficient deck tho.

<br/>

### 3.2.6. Enemies

The enemies will be the main threat for the player, they will have to be defeated in order to win the game. There will be different types of enemies, each one with their own characteristics. The enemies will follow the fastest path to the castle, and they will follow it until they reach it. The enemies will have different health points, speed, castle damage, armor defense and also special abilities that will be used to challenge the player. 

<br/>

### 3.2.7. Waves

The game will be divided into waves, each wave will have a different number of enemies, and each wave will be more difficult than the previous one. The player will have to defeat all the enemies of a wave in order to go to the next one. Every 5 waves, will have a boss wave, which will be more difficult than the previous waves, and will have a boss enemy. Before each wave, the player will have to place their towers and temples on the map, there won't be any time limit. Once the player has clicked the ready button, the enemies will start to spawn, and the player will have to defeat them.

<br/>

### 3.2.8. Castle

The castle is the main element of the game, it is the player's base, and it is the enemies will target, so the player will have to defend it at all cost. The castle will have 100 health points, and if the enemies reach it, they will deal damage to it. If the castle's health points reach 0, the player will lose the game. We recommend having a look at our spreadsheet to have a better understanding of the game mechanics and to get more details about the buildings, spells and enemies statistics.
