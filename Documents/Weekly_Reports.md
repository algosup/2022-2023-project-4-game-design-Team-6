# Weebly Reports for the Group 6

## Week 1

For the first week of the project we had 2 half days of project time. We managed to imagine a game, decide the genre, the design of the playground, start on some design for the cards,  and we created a spreadsheet defining the variables for the game: towers, enemies, waves, etc.
During that time the Program Manager started on his Functional; there should be enough at the start of next week for the Tech Lead to start on his Technical. The one page document has been done and sent to the professor.
