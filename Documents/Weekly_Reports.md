# Weebly Reports for the Group 6

## Week 1

For the first week of the project we had 2 half days of project time. We managed to imagine a game, decide the genre, the design of the playground, start on some design for the cards,  and we created a spreadsheet defining the variables for the game: towers, enemies, waves, etc.
During that time the Program Manager started on his Functional; there should be enough at the start of next week for the Tech Lead to start on his Technical. The one page document has been done and sent to the professor.

## Week 2

For the second week we had 2 half days of project time. We did a paper prototype; we decided on the style of the game; The Project Manager finished his functional, sent it to review, and started doing the sprites for the game. The Techlead started his Functional and the QA his Test Plan. The Software worked in the camera, the mouse controller, the entire card system and is currently worky=ing on the initialisation.
