# Roles Research

This document is a summary of the researches made during the project in order to help us understand our roles and how to work together.

## Game design tool (flowchart)

In order to give an idea on how our game will work, we created a flowchart. We used [Machinations](https://machinations.io/). We used this tool because it is easy to use and it is free.

## Game design tool (Create human-like enemies)

For our game we needed to have some "human-like enemies", by that we mean enemies that think and act like humans. We found a tool that can help us create those enemies. It is called [modl.ai](https://modl.ai/our_products/modl-play/). We didn't use it because we focused on an easier way to make the enemies movement.

## Create a game design document 

As we are creating a game, we thought it would be a good idea to create a game design document and technical design document. So we headed to this website: [Game Design Document](https://www.studytonight.com/3d-game-engineering-with-unity/tdd-and-gdd). But only a technical document was required for our project.

## Create a test plan

We needed to create a test plan for our game. We found this website: [How to create a test plan](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/how-to-create-a-test-plan-for-software-testing#toc-5 ). We used it to create our test plan. But it wasn't clear enough as we needed to create a test plan for a video game. So we found this website: [How to create a test plan for video game testing](https://qa-quest.com/2021/01/20/qa101-how-to-create-a-plan-for-video-game-testing/). We used this one to create our test plan. We also realized that there was different types of testing on this blog post: [Types of testing](https://game-ace.com/blog/types-of-game-testing/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20activities%20that,objectively%20neutral%20form%20of%20testing). We then needed to create test cases for our game, and found this website: [How to create test cases](https://qa-quest.com/2021/02/19/qa-101-how-to-write-awesome-test-cases/.), it was very helpful. We also had to test the rules of our game, so we found this website: [How to test rules](https://qa-quest.com/2021/01/06/qa101-how-to-use-the-7-testing-principles-in-video-game-qa/). We used it to create our test cases. We then needed to create a test report, so we found this website: [How to create a test report](https://www.qatouch.com/blog/how-to-write-qa-test-summary-report/). We used it to create our test report.
